# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection
Driver drowsiness detection is a Sem 5 mini project for my computer engineering college built using Dlib and OpenCV with Python as a backend language.

---

# Logic of project
The project includes direct working with the 68 facial landmark detector and also the face detector of the Dlib library.
The 68 facial landmark detector is a robustly trained efficient detector which detects the points on the human face using which 
we determine whether the eyes are open or they are closed.</br></br>

# The working of the project
<ul><li>As you can see the<b> above screenshot</b> where the landmarks are detected using the detector.
<li>Now we are taking the ratio which is described as <i>'Sum of distances of vertical landmarks divided by twice the distance between horizontal landmarks'</i>.
<li>Now this ratio is totally dependent on your system which you may configure accordingly for the thresholds of sleeping, drowsy, active.</ul>
